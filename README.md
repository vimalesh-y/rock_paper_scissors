# Rock, paper, scissors

I recreate the rock, paper, scissors game in Python. Main focus is to utilise while loops with 'break' (stop while loop) and 'continue' statements (to stay within loop if condition not satisfied).

## Requirements

- Tested on Python version 3.12.4, which also pulled in pip (version 24.2)
